<!-- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -->
<div class="summary-box">
  <p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong> 
Team Steward made strong progress in Week 14 as all members advanced into final project closure. Most projects remained on track with major deliverables completed, including Bite-Sized Lesson drafts, updated resumes and portfolios, and ongoing certification coursework. The team shared common challenges around end-of-semester workload and balancing job applications with project tasks, but collaboration and shared strategies helped maintain momentum. As the semester closes, members are focused on stakeholder outreach, final documentation, and aligning all artifacts for submission in Week 15.</p>

  <p class="label">Summary:</p>
  <p>This week I submitted five IT job applications, finalized the script for my Bite-Sized Lesson Final, and began searching for potential networking contacts to interview for the stakeholder engagement requirement.</p>

  <p class="label">Challenge / Risk:</p>
  <p>Balancing certification study with job applications and preparation for stakeholder interviews may require tighter scheduling as the semester closes.</p>

  <p class="label">Next Step:</p>
  <p>Record the Bite-Sized Lesson video, complete at least two stakeholder outreach attempts, and continue submitting additional applications.</p>

  <details class="subweek">
    <summary>🗓️ Week 10 – 🟢 On Track</summary>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The project remains on track and is now entering the Certification & Visibility phases.
